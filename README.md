# Workforce-Retention-Intelligence-System
This project aims to address a real-world HR challenge faced by an ITeS company â€” **Code & Run**, which is experiencing a persistently high employee attrition rate of **20%**, much higher than the internal target of **5%**.

The goal of the project is to:
- Analyze and understand the key drivers of attrition.
- Build a machine learning model to **predict which employees are likely to leave**.
- Develop **actionable insights** through **Power BI dashboards** to support HR in reducing attrition.
